# Scala.js with sbt, Vite, Laminar and Chart.js

This is an example of putting together:

* [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/)
* [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* [Slinky](https://slinky.dev/)

## Install

Install [nix](https://nixos.org/download).

## Prepare

Before doing anything, including before importing in an IDE, run

```
# nix-shell .
$ npm install
```

## Development

Open two terminals.
In the first one, start `sbt` and, within, continuously build the Scala.js project:

```
$ sbt
...
> ~fastLinkJS
...
```

In the second one, start the Vite development server with

```
$ npm run dev
...
```

Follow the URL presented to you by Vite to open the application.

You can now continuously edit the `Main.scala` file, and Vite will automatically reload the page on save.

## Production build

Make a production build with

```
$ npm run build
```

You can then find the built files in the `dist/` directory.
You will need an HTTP server, such as `python3 -m http.server`, to open the files, as Vite rewrites `<script>` tags to prevent cross-origin requests.
